# BattleShip

battleship is a traditional battleship game created on a 10x10 grid. This game is very simple and requires two players
to play on the same machine, passing it over to each other the old fashion way.

The way the game works is that players will first place all of their boats in the desired spots and then the next 
player will do the same.

Afterwards wwhen one player has won, a new tab will appear and the game will be over
